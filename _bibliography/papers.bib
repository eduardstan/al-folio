	abstract	= {Multivariate temporal, or time, series classification is, in a way, the temporal generalization of (numeric) classification, as every instance is described by multiple time series instead of multiple values. Symbolic classification is the machine learning strategy to extract explicit knowledge from a data set, and the problem of symbolic classification of multivariate temporal series requires the design, implementation, and test of ad-hoc machine learning algorithms, such as, for example, algorithms for the extraction of temporal versions of decision trees. One of the most well-known algorithms for decision tree extraction from categorical data is Quinlan's ID3, which was later extended to deal with numerical attributes, resulting in an algorithm known as C4.5, and implemented in many open-sources data mining libraries, including the so-called Weka, which features an implementation of C4.5 called J48. ID3 was recently generalized to deal with temporal data in form of timelines, which can be seen as discrete (categorical) versions of multivariate time series, and such a generalization, based on the interval temporal logic HS, is known as Temporal ID3. In this paper we introduce Temporal C4.5, that allows the extraction of temporal decision trees from undiscretized multivariate time series, describe its implementation, called Temporal J48, and discuss the outcome of a set of experiments with the latter on a collection of public data sets, comparing the results with those obtained by other, classical, multivariate time series classification methods.},

	abstract={Model checking is a very well-known problem, with many practical applications. A possible declination of such a problem in the interval logic setting is the so-called finite model checking, that consists of verifying an interval temporal logic formula, typically of Halpern and Shoham’s logic of Allen’s relations HS, on a fully represented finite interval model. A multivariate time series is a collection of temporally ordered sets of values, and they allow to describe a variety of situations, such as the medical history of an hospitalized patient or the sensor values during
a plane flight. In this paper we argue how the recently introduced fuzzy generalization of interval temporal logic is a suitable language in which interesting properties of a multivariate time series can be expressed and checked, and we define, solve, and discuss the complexity of the multivariate time series fuzzy interval logic checking.}

	abstract={Regression analysis is the statistical process used to estimate the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In machine learning, typical statistical approaches to regression such as linear regression are often replaced with symbolic learning, such as decision tree regression, to capture non-linear behaviour while keeping the interpretability of the results. For temporal series, regression is sometimes enhanced by using historical values of the independent variables. In this paper, we show how temporal regression can be handled by a symbolic learner based on interval temporal logic decision trees.},

Here, we generalize the latter result to the case of sparse ultimately-periodic models.},

	abstract={Association rule extraction is a very well-known and important problem in machine learning, and especially in the sub-field of explainable machine learning. Association rules are naturally extracted from data sets with Boolean (or at least categorical) attributes. In order for rule extraction algorithms to be applicable to data sets with numerical attributes as well, data must be suitably discretized, and a great amount of work has been devoted to finding good discretization algorithms, taking into account that optimal discretization is a NP-hard problem. Motivated by a specific application, in this paper we provide a novel discretization algorithm defined as an (heuristic) optimization problem and solved by an evolutionary algorithm, and we test its performances against well-known available solutions, proving (experimentally) that we are able to extract more rules in a easier way.}

	abstract={Supervised classification is one of the main computational tasks of modern Artificial Intelligence, and it is used to automatically extract an underlying theory from a set of already classified instances. The available learning schemata are mostly limited to static instances, in which the temporal component of the information is absent, neglected, or abstracted into atemporal data, and purely, native temporal classification is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a temporal rule-based classifier based on interval temporal logic, that is able to learn a classification model for multivariate classified (abstracted) time series, and we discuss some implementation issues.}

	abstract={The primary characteristic of interval temporal logic is that intervals, rather than points, are taken as the primitive ontological entities. Given their generally bad computational behaviour, several techniques exist to produce decidable and computationally affordable temporal logics based on intervals. In this paper we take inspiration from Golumbic and Shamir's coarser interval algebras, which generalize the classical Allen's Interval Algebra, in order to define two previously unknown variants of Halpern and Shoham's logic (HS) based on coarser relations. We prove that, perhaps surprisingly, the satisfiability problem for the coarsest of the two variants, namely {HS$_3$}, not only is decidable, but PSPACE-complete in the finite/discrete case, and PSPACE-hard in any other case; besides proving its model-theoretic properties, we implement a tableau-based satisfiability checker for it, and test it against a systematically generated benchmark. Our results are strengthened by showing that not all coarser-than-Allen's relations are a guarantee of decidability, as we prove that the second variant, namely {HS$_7$}, remains undecidable in all interesting cases.},

	abstract={Decision trees are simple, yet powerful, classification models used to classify categorical and numerical data, and, despite their simplicity, they are commonly used in operations research and management, as well as in knowledge mining. From a logical point of view, a decision tree can be seen as a structured set of logical rules written in propositional logic. Since knowledge mining is rapidly evolving towards temporal knowledge mining, and since in many cases temporal information is best described by interval temporal logics, propositional logic decision trees may evolve towards interval temporal logic decision trees. In this paper, we define the problem of interval temporal logic decision tree learning, and propose a solution that generalizes classical decision tree learning.},

The current literature contains a number of different algorithms and experiments that allow one to abstract temporal series and, later, extract meaningful rules from them. In this paper, we approach this problem in a rather general way, without resorting, as many other methods, to expert knowledge and ad-hoc solutions. Our very simple temporal abstraction method allows us to transform time series into timelines, which can be then used for logical temporal rule extraction using an already existing temporal adaptation of the algorithm APRIORI. We have tested this approach on real data, obtaining promising results.},

In this paper we describe an implementation of a tableau-based satisfiability checker for HS3 interpreted in the class of all finite linear orders.}
