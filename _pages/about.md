He studies how to reduce the gap between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). In particular, he is interested in (Interval) Temporal Symbolic Learning where the induced theory is described by formulas of Temporal Logics.

He likes interdisciplinarity. He enjoys when people are motivated. As being a team player, he likes to share with others and to work with people that come from different research areas. Moreover, he loves animals (especially dogs) and snowboarding.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
