## Introduction

Every formal science needs a language to be able for expressing results and communicate information with others in a comprehensible way. Logicâ€™s purpose is to study this formal representation without ambiguity in terms of a formal language. It is obvious that there is no universal logical language to represent every science. Logic is that part of science that provides to humans those crucial mathematical mechanisms to securely control reasonings. <!---Artificial Intelligence (AI) is among the most representative witnesses that uses logic to, e.g., represent knowledge.--->

The goal is to present a journey through a possible set of formal languages (actively) used in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
